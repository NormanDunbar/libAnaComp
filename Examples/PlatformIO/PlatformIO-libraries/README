This directory contains the libAnaComp library source files for the PlatformIO versions of the example sketches. This saves each example having to duplicate the libAnaComp source files in each sketch.

You could, if you wished, copy the libanacomp directory and its contents, into the lib diretory in each example to obtain the same result.

Doing it this way does mean one copy of the library is used for all the examples.

The platformio.ini file has a line:

	lib_extra_dirs = ../PlatformIO-libraries/

to allow this pseudo-global library to be found.
